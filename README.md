# My-Competitive-Coding-Templates

This repository contains templates that I use for my personal competitive programming practice. It includes templates for five popular programming languages: **C**, **C++**, **C#**, **Java**, and **Python**. These templates help me quickly get started with solving problems by providing basic utilities, such as I/O handling, modular arithmetic, and other common functions.

## Introduction

This repository is designed to store the coding templates I use for competitive programming. It serves as a personal reference for quickly setting up coding environments across various languages. Each template includes the commonly used functions that help with handling input/output, modular arithmetic, prime checking, factorial calculations, and other typical tasks that come up in competitive programming.

Although this repository is primarily for my use, feel free to explore and utilize the templates if they are useful for your competitive programming practice.

## Languages Available

This repository includes templates for the following programming languages:

- **C**
- **C++**
- **C#**
- **Java**
- **Python**

You can easily navigate to the respective language template in the repository and copy it to your own project or problem folder.
